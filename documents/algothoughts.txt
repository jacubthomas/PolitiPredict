For algorithm to work, effectively multiple processing techniques will need to
applied to the input text. Things such as Naive Bayes word weighting, semantics +
sentimental evaluation, etc.

Ultimately, each processing technique should contribute to a fractional of the
score/ruling. Something as simple as:

    SCORE = (Bayes)PARTY * 0.33 + (S+S)PARTY * 0.66

        where SCORE, PARTY are vectors, (Liberal, Conservative, ...)

    if SCORE_l > SCORE_r and |Score_l - Score_r| > Epsilon:

        ruling = Liberal

    elif  SCORE_l < SCORE_r and |Score_l - Score_r| > Epsilon:

        ruling = Conservative

    else
        ruling = Moderate
