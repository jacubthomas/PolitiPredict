For this project, my primary endgoal is to assess a given input text and return
the political bias (party) it may stem from. I will do so by combining various
natural language processing techniques. I would then to find a meaningful way
to visualize these results.

    Perhaps some other interesting outputs aside from the assessed bias lie in
    the evidence which helped determine the ruling:
        1) output sentiment towards proper nouns
            i.e. "Obama has helped millions attain affordable medical care"

            sentiment towards Obama:
                pos: .801, neut: .199, neg: 0

            aggregate sentiment towards Obama:
                liberal - pos: .663, neut: .249, neg: .088
                conservative - pos: .154, neut: .285, neg: .561

            Senti ruling: Liberal

        2) Semantic, different from sentiment:
            how does each party connect nouns to other nouns?
            i.e. Trump economy
            
            r - trump is helping economy
            l - trump is hurting climate efforts

        3) Output Naive Bayes weighting:
                processed input = (Obama) + (helped) + (millions) + (attain) 
                    + (affordable) + (medical) + (care)

                L : (.000671) + (.0000256) + (.0000199) + (0.00000884)
                    + (.000356) + (.000243) + (.0000715) = .00139584
                R : .000452) + (.0000283) + (.0000214) + (0.00000884)
                    + (.0000998) + (.000208) + (.0000771) =.00089544
                
                L .00139584 > .00089544 R
                
                Top word deltas: Obama, affordable, ...

            NB ruling: Liberal

Some stretch goals for me: 

1) implement a means for boiling a statement down to
raw facts. where it can be helpful to know who the tale comes from, it can be
also helpful to strip the bias to facts.

2) identify opposing political opinion and, further, return quotes which
reflect their side of the story. The former may be as trivial assuming the
counterstatement and the former may be more complicated than time permits.
