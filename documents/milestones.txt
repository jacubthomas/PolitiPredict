Algo:

    - implement NB

    - implement S+S

    - combine scores with disparate weights and make ruling

    - test

    - tune

Output:

    - determine data relevant for output

    - determine means/style of output


Input:
    - Which dataset to use
        reddit from kaggle
        more formal dataset (news articals)
            - pre-existing
            - manually scraped
    
    - How can data remain relevant

    - How can data be added into mix over time
